# Recommendation-Engine

The Recommendation system we built analyzes the data and comes up with the best recommendations that have similar content or high ratings.
It takes the database, filters it and then uses functions to finalize the results and prints the title of the movies most similar to the given movie. It also uses a weighted average method to score movies and obtain highest rated movies.
